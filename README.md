## Description

The memory game is a project part of my Udacity FEND Nano Degree. It is a complete browser-based card matching game (also know as Concentration).

The project rubric is available here:
[ Memory Game project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view).

## Instructions

To play the game:
1. Start clicking on cards (the timer will start);
2. Try, using your memory, to match the cards (the moves are counted);
3. The game is over when all cards are matched, you will get a star rating:
   - 3 stars for less than 14 moves
   - 2 stars for less than 20 moves
   - 1 star for more than 20 moves

## Contributing

The project has 2 contributors: me and Richard from Udacity, who did the initial commit for the starter code.
I also used some CSS styling for the modal from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp).
